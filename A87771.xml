         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <label>The Proofe.</label>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, for that this aſſembling and demeaning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this manner, as the caſe is put, is a breach of the Peace, and that in the higheſt degree; now every man may take up Armes; to preſerve the Peace, nay ought, if otherwiſe it cannot be preſerved, though it be onely in danger to be broken, in particular private Towns, and by a ſmall number of perſons: and therefore if two fall out and fight, and the one killeth the other, and a third man ſtand by, and doe not endeabour to part them, or prevent the breach of the Peace, this third man is to be amerced, <hi>3 Edw. 3. Item. Northampton, Corone 293.</hi> But by M. <hi>Lambert,</hi> he is to be fined, and impriſoned, <hi>Lam.

Dalton Office of Sheriffs, 136,</hi> and if they faſle in perfor, mance of their duties therein, they are to be fined and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155858:3"/>and if any refuſe to ayd them therein, they are in like manner to be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, for that this aſſembling and demeaning themſelves as aforeſaid, is <hi>in terrorem populi Domini Regis,</hi> in amazement of the Kings Liege-people, and ſo a riot, rout, and unlawfull aſſembly. Now if the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of there or more perſons, aſſemble themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to doe an unlawfull act, all perſons in the County where the ſame aſſembly is, being able to travell, are to ayd and aſſiſt the Iuſtices of the Peace, and Sheriffs to reſiſt, repell, and take ſuch offenders, and that under paine of impriſonment, fine, and ranſome by the Statute <hi>2 Hen. 5. cap. 8. a fortiori,</hi> where unlawfull acts are done, as in the cafe put.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, for that this aſſembling and demeaning of themſelves as aforeſaid, is by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Laws of this Kingdome high Treaſon; every Rebellion is high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo was it reſolved and adiudged by all the Iudges of <hi>England, paſch. 39</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> of that multitude then aſſembled in warlike manner to pull downe Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, in thoſe places, where they had no colour to claime Common, and ſo was adiudged by the whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>29 Hen. 6. cap. 2.</hi> in <hi>Cades</hi> rebellion, that he was a Traytor, and the leavying of Armes within this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in warlike manner, without lawfull cauſe, is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and ſo Treaſon; and ſo it is reſolved, <hi>Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Dier 13 Eliz. 298.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by the Laws of this Land, all are bound to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and take all Felons and Traytors, under the penalties before mentioned; yea, I conceive, under grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For if <hi>A</hi> commit Treaſon, and <hi>B</hi> know it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it, it is miſpriſion of Treaſon, and he ſhall forfeit
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155858:4"/>therefore all his goods, and the profit of his Lands du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life; and much more where be doth refuſe to aſſiſt in apprehending, and puniſhing the offenders. If the aſſemblers to pull downe Incloſures afore mentioned, were adIudged Traytors, much more theſe Rebels aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to pull downe the Incloſures namely, the fence of our Religion, Laws and Liberties, <hi>viz.</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the onely Fence and Guard we have in this Kingdome, againſt ruine of Religion, Lawes, and Liberties, the generall medicine, to cure all our grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the life of our lives and livelyhoods.</p>
            <p>And that this is the maine intention of this Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appeareth, not onely by their owne ſpeeches, but alſo for that:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, they perſwaded the King to abſent himſelfe from the Parliament, thereby to nullifie (as much as in them lay) the benefit and profit, that the Kingdom might receive thereby.</item>
                  <item>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to detaine divers Members of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, from returning to the Houſes whereof they were Members.</item>
                  <item>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, to withhold divers Delinquents from being brought to anſwer their crimes.</item>
                  <item>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, to go to the Houſe of Commons to demand the five Members, with ſuch an attendance, as might have been the ruine and death of all that had oppoſed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The principall Caſe, and all the other Caſes in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereunto are put, as ſuppoſing the King not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and then the Concluſions thereupon are ſo apparent, that all men that have their right ſences will agree the ſame to be the Common Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; therefore the Caſe is further put:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155858:4"/>
               <hi>Admit that this Aſſembly is by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and that others are prohibited by the King to oppoſe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Quare 2.</label> 
               <hi>WHat alterations are thereby made of the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions aforeſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſwer.</label> NOne at all.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is not to be beleeved that they have the Kings command, for that His Maſeſty hath off promiſed by divers Dedatations, and alſo proteſted by his ſolemne Proteſtations, that he will rule and governe his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iects by and according to the knowne Lawes of this Kingdome; both which Promiſes and Proteſtations were broken, if His Maieſty ſhould command the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the foreſaid perſons, in manner as aforeſaid; or to doe or commit the outrages aforeſaid, being both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and contrary to the knowne Lawes of this Kingdome, as before is apparently manifeſted.</p>
            <p>And therefore his MaIeſties command by word is not ſufficient, but it muſt be in all Caſes to Iuſtifie the party, by or from ſome of his Courts of Iuſtice, or under ſome of his MaIeſties Seales thereunto Appointed, <hi>Co.

            <p>For inſtance, The King commands <hi>A</hi> to arreſt <hi>B</hi> without cauſe, (which is an unlawfull act) and <hi>A</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly doth arreſt hun; <hi>B</hi> may have an Action of falſe impriſonment againſt <hi>A</hi> notwithſtanding the Kings command, 16 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>numende faits</hi> 182.

            <p>The ſame Law is, if the king command <hi>A</hi> to take away the Gods of <hi>B</hi> without Iuſt cauſe, and <hi>A</hi> doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, <hi>A</hi> ſhall therefore be puniſhed, as if no ſuch command had béen, as appeareth by the preſent expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the late Sheriffes, for taking away mens Goods for the Shipmoney; and by the Officers of Monopolies, who have not in any manner beene excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

            <p>If the Rebels in <hi>Ireland</hi> had, (as they pretend they have) the kings Commiſſion for what they doe, it would not in any manner abate or mitigate their offence, but that it ſhould be high Treaſon, and they to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and proceeded againſt as if they had no ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: and the ſame Law is in the caſe put, of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aſſembled here in <hi>England,</hi> in like Rebellious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforeſaid.</p>
